### About market
What's this repo all about, you may ask. Well, it's a test of [Angularfirebase](https://github.com/firebase/angularfire), [AngularJS 1.6.X](https://angularjs.org), [AngularJS Material](https://material.angularjs.org) and [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase) into one. <!--TODO: Make about longer-->

### Current Status
The website is currently in **BETA**.

### Q & A
**Q.** Where's the source code? I want it!!

**A.** Unfortunately, I'm still working on it and it will come out as soon as possible.

**Q.** Where can I find the website?

**A.** The website will come ASAP.

**Q.** How on earth do you deploy `AngularJS` code?

**A.** Simple. I just use [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server) installed via `npm install -g lite-server`.

**Q.** Where can I find the docs for `AngularJS` and `AngularJS Material`?

**A.** Here you go: [Angular4 Docs](https://angularjs.org) and [Angular Material 2 Docs](https://material.angularjs.org)

### NOTES
- I am planning to release a prerelease version every 1 week _(or 2 weeks?)_ <!--TODO: Decide for no. of weeks before next release-->
- The reason why I changed the link to the website was because I had to change it when it comes out of beta, thus, I saved time by doing so earlier.
- If you see the project as inactive, it is most probably because I am doing local testing.
