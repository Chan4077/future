## About market2
What's this repo all about, you may ask. Well, it's a test of [Angularfirebase2](https://github.com/angular/angularfirebase2), [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular), [Angular Material 2](https://github.com/angular/material2), [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Firebase](https://github.com/firebase) into one. <!--TODO: Make about longer-->

## Q & A
**Q.** Where's the source code? I want it!!

**A.** Unfortunately, I'm still working on it and it will come out as soon as possible. <!--TODO: Add link to source code for market2-->

**Q.** Where can I find the website?

**A.** The website is [here](https://market2beta.firebaseapp.com/), although if you view it now, it will show an error as I have not deployed the code yet and am testing it on [@angular/cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli). <!--TODO: Make website deploy-->
